abstract = "Cognitive control is what makes us able to form our actions towards our aims. It is observed that the level of control in the trials of sequential cognitive control tasks (e.g., Stroop) is modulated by the congruency of the previous trial. This phenomenon opens a window to understand the mechanisms of this fundamental ability. There are competing accounts to explain this sequential effect. Our primary focus is to test the assumption that the experience of negative affect is the trigger of the increase in control. We have developed a new testing procedure which specializes the direct assessment of this hypothesis."
