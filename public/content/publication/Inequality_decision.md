abstract = "In this project, we investigate how economic inequality and poverty influences decision-making processes and how these biased processes form the society. For example, in our latest studies, we found that economic inequality increases financial hardship for low-income individuals and by that makes the poor even poorer further increasing the level of inequality in the society. We also study ways to design interventions which can break this vicious cycle."
