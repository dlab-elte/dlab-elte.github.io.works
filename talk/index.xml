&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customary statistical
methods in psychology do not communicate the degree to
which the collected data serve as evidence for the experimental
hypothesis. In order to estimate the strength of evidence in
significant psychological results, we calculated Bayes factors
for 287,424 findings of 35,515 articles published in 293
psychological journals between 1985 and 2016. Overall, 55%
of all analyzed results were found to provide strong evidence
(Bayes factor (BF) &amp;gt;10) for the alternative hypothesis, while
more than half of the remaining results do not pass the level
of the anecdotal evidence (BF=3). The results estimate that at
least 82% of all published psychological articles contain one or
more significant results which do not pass BF=10. This analysis
highlights that due to the threshold of acceptance having been
set too low for psychological findings, a substantial proportion
of the published effects have weak evidential support.&lt;/p&gt;
